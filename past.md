# Past

Assorted interesting bits that helped get me to where I am today

## Web Framework - PHP/MySQL

Started in the later part of my senior year of High School, I wrote a PHP framework that I used to power older versions of my site.

## 2D Game Engine - <span>C#</span>

Started after graduation from North Carolina State University, I wrote the beginnings of a [2D game engine](https://github.com/kfdm/murasaki) in C# to become more familiar with the language and tools.
