In the process of researching for some of my other projects, I tend to use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) to collect and organize pages. Like many applications, there are always parts that I wish were different, so I hope to use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) as a bridge into my own system where I can experiment with bookmark management
