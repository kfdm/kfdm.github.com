title: About
---

I'm a software developer who currently lives in [Fukuoka], Japan. I enjoy focusing on backend work, tooling, and operations, so that others can focus on the parts that are most fun to them and not worry about lower level things.

I prefer to work with [Python] and [Django] for most of my projects, though I can use shell script or ruby or other languages as needed for the project at hand.

# Current Interests

- Configuration and automation using [SaltStack]
- Tools for [time management] and [quantified-self]
- [activitypub] and other services built around [fediverse]
