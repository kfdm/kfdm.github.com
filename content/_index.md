title: About
---

I'm a software developer who currently lives in [Fukuoka], Japan. I enjoy focusing
on backend work, tooling, and operations, so that others can focus on the parts
that are most fun to them and not worry about lower level things.

I prefer to work with [Python] and [Django] for most of my projects, though I can use shell script or ruby or other
languages as needed for the project at hand.

Current Interests:

* Configuration and automation using [SaltStack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt)
* Scheduling and Calendar applications using [iCalendar](https://github.com/collective/icalendar)
* Building modular sites using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
  * [django-pomodoro](https://github.com/kfdm/django-pomodoro)
  * [django-quotedb](https://github.com/kfdm/django-qdb/)
  * [django-simplestats](https://github.com/kfdm/django-simplestats)
