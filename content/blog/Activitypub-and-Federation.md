Recently I've started to be interested in [activitypub] and how it connects projects like [Mastodon] or [Pixelfed] as alternatives to centralized services such as Facebook and Instagram. For my blog, I'm generally fine with things such as atom and rss (though there seems to be a way to bridge a [feed] to activity pub) for something like [quickstats] it may be nice to consider how to federate.
