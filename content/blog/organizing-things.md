Recently I've been thinking about the site [Everything I know] and the [alfred-my-mind] extension to make it easy to search. Some of the ideas there are similar to the ideas I have for my [worklog] project. There are probably things I can update with my own Alfred [workflow] to make it smarter about searching through pages.

Regarding time, I'm still developing my own time tracker, though I stumbled on [toggl] and [timery] which look like they have some ideas I could borrow, like project buckets and color coding.

I stumbled upon [raindrop] which looks like it may be a reasonable replacement for [pinboard] due to having better maintained mobile apps. Curious to see what their upcoming api will support.

While I have been using [moneydance] to record my expenses, I'm curious to try out [lunchmoney] due to it's better support for mixed currency.
