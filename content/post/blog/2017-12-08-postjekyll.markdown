title: Post Jekyll?
---

In general, I've been mostly happy with [Jekyll], it handles most of my basic requirements but whenever it comes to doing more customizing various index pages or generating some automatic indexes, the [GitHub Pages] version gets a little more annoying to work with. I could easily self-host which would allow me more flexibility to automatically generate more parts or hook in additional plugins, but if I were to self host, then I'm not necessarily limited to Jekyll. I could check out something like [Pelican] or [Lektor] or perhaps roll my own. I quite like the simplicity of writing blog posts in plain markdown with Jekyll, it's just all the other customization that gets a bit annoying.
