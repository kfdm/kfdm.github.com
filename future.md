# Future

Various projects that I may want to work on at some time in the future.

## Unified Alert Gem

Tools like growl and prowl are useful, but it would be nice if there was a tool that could more easily combine all of them into one tool, to make it trivial to send any kind of notification out. Some of my initial notes are listed in the README for my [alert-gem](https://github.com/kfdm/alert-gem#readme) project page.

## Some kind of 2D Game

I have been interested in building a game for a long time. I started a prototype of one I called [murasaki](http://www.wegame.com/view/murasaki/) before I got my current job but never got very far with it. I would like to do something in the style of [Link to the Past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past) or [Mega Man 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_2) likely using the [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) editor.

## Heroku/PHPFog like deploy system

I would like to make things much easier to deploy while I'm working. I'm looking at [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and [PHPFog](https://www.phpfog.com/) for inspiration. This would likely combine a Ruby Gem that provides a command line interface for deploying, with a web dashboard. Similar to some of the work I did for an internal deploy panel at WeGame. I will eventually post my updated work under my [deploy](https://github.com/kfdm/deploy) project.
