#### [Python GNTP Library](https://github.com/kfdm/gntp)
Wrote an implementation of the [Growl Notification Transport Protocol](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/gntp.aspx) in Python.  Also wrote a prototype listen server that can listen for GNTP messages and [regrowl](https://github.com/kfdm/gntp-regrowl) them to the local OSX machine.

#### [Python library for TheHitList](https://github.com/kfdm/thehitlist)
Provides a python library to access [The Hit List](http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/) through appscript's python to apple script bridge.  Currently in its early stages.  Will eventually be used to provide a method of importing entries from task trackers such as Piviotal Tracker or dates from Google Calendar and convert them into tasks.

#### Misc scripts
I've written various other scripts.  For irssi I've written [irssi-nohilite](https://github.com/kfdm/irssi-nohilight) and
[irssi-growl](https://github.com/kfdm/irssi-growl) by hacking together a bit of perl code.

I wrote [iTunes-lyrics-artwork](https://github.com/kfdm/itunes-lyrics-artwork) to figure out songs in my library that were missing
artwork or lyrics.

I wrote [radio-growl](https://github.com/kfdm/radio-growl) and [radio](https://github.com/kfdm/radio) 
to notify me what songs were playing on a radio station I enjoy.
