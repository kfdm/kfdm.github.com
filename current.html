<h4><a href="http://github.com/kfdm/gntp">Python GNTP Library</a></h4>
<p>Wrote an implementation of the Growl Notification Transport Protocol in Python.  Includes a prototype listen server that can listen for GNTP messages and 'regrowl' them to the local OSX machine.</p>

<h4><a href="http://github.com/kfdm/thehitlist">Python library for The Hit List</a></h4>
<p>Provides a python library to access The Hit List through appscript's python to apple script bridge.  Currently in its early stages.  Will eventually be used to provide a method of importing entries from task trackers such as Piviotal Tracker or dates from Google Calendar and convert them into tasks.</p>

<h4>Misc scripts</h4>
<p>I've written various other scripts.  For irssi I've written <a href="http://github.com/kfdm/irssi-nohilight">irssi-nohilight</a> and <a href="http://github.com/kfdm/irssi-growl">irssi-growl</a> by hacking together a bit of perl code.
I wrote <a href="http://github.com/kfdm/itunes-lyrics-artwork">iTunes-lyrics-artwork</a> to figure out songs in my library that were missing artwork or lyrics.  I wrote <a href="http://github.com/kfdm/radio-growl">radio-growl</a> and <a href="http://github.com/kfdm/radio">radio</a> 
to notify me what songs were playing on a radio station I enjoy.
