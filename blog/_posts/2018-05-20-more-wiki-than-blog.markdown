I'm still debating replacing [Jekyll] with something else but I'm not super enthusiastic about writing a blog system. One furstration with many software packages is when it does almost everything you want except for a small bit. Typically your only recourse is to build the entire thing from scratch. Though I'm not very fond of [Liquid] templates since I'm more used to [Django Templates], I think the biggest issue I have with [Jekyll] is some of the [special cases] particuarlly with posts being special collections but regular pages are unable to take advantage of tags without workarounds.
