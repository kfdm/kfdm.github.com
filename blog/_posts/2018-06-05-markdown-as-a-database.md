Partly inspired by apps such as [NotePlan] or the [friends] project, I'm intrigued by the idea of using Markdown as a database. The popularity of static site generators such as [hugo] and [jekyll] already forgo using a database by having the main content as a Markdown document with metadata contained in yaml frontmatter. My own [worklog] experiment is built op top of jekyll with some scripts to parse out the frontmatter. I suppose the biggest worry would be dealing with merge conflicts depending on if something like iCloud sync was used or building on top of git
