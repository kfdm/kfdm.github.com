[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a tool that provides a more featured alternative to the built in spotlight bar. The place where it shines the most is support to easily add your own search targets and programable workflows.

Some workflows that I use on a regular basis
* [alfred-convert](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-convert)
* [alfred-github-workflow](https://github.com/gharlan/alfred-github-workflow)
* [alfred-repos](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-repos)
* [TimeZones](http://geekzone.philosophicalzombie.net/post/45823505821/alfred-workflow-timezones-a-customizable-world)
